# AAB
For genomic differential analysis and carbohydrate active enzyme analysis of acetic acid bacteria (AAB).  
In this repository we include the code to calculate the differences in several genomic characteristics between all members of acetic acid bacteria. We also perform of the alpha and beta diversity analysis of carbohydrate active enzymes diversity for a subset of these bacteria. We include one genome per species of acetic acid bacteria for their study of CAZyme activity.
